//! Sync engine for replicated vault tables.
//!
//! The manifest declares which tables replicate, how their columns form field groups, and how
//! each group merges. Capture triggers rendered from the manifest record local changes in
//! `sync_capture`; the engine seals them into signed operations, stores remote operations, and
//! applies them with deterministic merges so every replica converges.
//!
//! Capture suppression depends on the single-connection invariant of vault pools: the
//! `sync_apply_state.applying` flag is only correct because nothing interleaves inside an engine
//! transaction.
//!
//! Every engine entry point takes the vault connection and runs in its own transaction, so a
//! failure leaves engine state and domain tables as they were.
