## Download

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/opengrimoire/ganbaru-ai/releases/latest).

| Platform | Download |
|---|---|
| **Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint** | `.deb` package |
| **Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE** | `.rpm` package |
| **Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda** | `ganbaru-ai-bin` from the AUR |
| **Other Linux x64 desktops** | `.AppImage` |
| **Windows 10 or Windows 11 x64** | `.msi` installer, or the `.exe` setup if preferred |
| **macOS** | Not available yet. macOS builds are planned, but they need Apple hardware and signing before release. |
| **Android** | Not available yet. A substantial Android implementation exists in source, but release validation and signing are incomplete. |
| **iOS** | Not available yet. iOS depends on the same Apple build and signing path as macOS. |

Arch-based distro users can install with `yay -S ganbaru-ai-bin` or another AUR helper.

Use `SHA256SUMS` if you want to check that your downloaded installer matches the checksum published with this release. The `.sig` files and `latest.json` are used by Ganbaru AI's built-in updater, not files you need to download.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 LTS recommended. Node 22.12.0 or newer is also supported while Node 22 remains maintained.
- [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) enabled for the pinned [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 11 version in `package.json`
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) via rustup, using the toolchain pinned in [rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml) (edition 2024)
- Tauri v2 system dependencies for your platform: [v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opengrimoire/ganbaru-ai.git
cd ganbaru-ai
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/client run tauri dev
```

### Android development on a physical device

Android development requires [Tauri's mobile prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#android), Android Studio or an equivalent SDK installation, and JDK 21. Install Android SDK Platform 36, Platform Tools, Build Tools 35.0.0, Command-line Tools, and NDK 30.0.15729638. Set `ANDROID_HOME` and `NDK_HOME`, and make `adb` from Platform Tools available on `PATH`. The repository wrapper resolves JDK 21 through `GANBARU_AI_ANDROID_JAVA_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`, or a supported system installation.

For the usual ARM64 physical-device workflow, install the Rust target once:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
```

Use an Android 10 or newer device and a data-capable USB cable. Enable Developer options and USB debugging, connect the device, unlock it, and approve the computer's debugging key. See Android's [hardware-device guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) for operating-system-specific USB setup.

Confirm that ADB reports the device with the state `device`, not `unauthorized` or `offline`:

```bash
adb devices
```

Then run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/client run tauri android dev --host 127.0.0.1
```

This installs the separate `.dev` application identity and keeps the frontend development server on the USB and ADB loopback path instead of exposing it to the local network. Keep the terminal running for logs and hot reload. Native Rust or Android changes may trigger a rebuild and reinstall.

For an ordinary contribution, test the changed flow on the physical device, including Android Back, background and resume, rotation or responsive layout, and relevant permission denial or recovery. A debug launch is not release acceptance. Use the complete [Android testing matrix](docs/testing/android.md) for lifecycle, storage, notifications, media, Doomscrolling, artifact, and release validation.

### Browser extension local testing

The Doomscrolling extension is tested as an unpacked Chromium extension during development. The registration helper below supports Linux and macOS and applies to Chrome, Chromium, Brave, and Edge. It does not create the native-host manifest and registry key required on Windows, so Windows registration remains a manual tooling gap.

From the repo root, build the native messaging host and generate the dev extension folder:

```bash
pnpm -w run setup:chromium-extension
```

Open the browser's extensions page, enable developer mode, load `extensions/chrome` as the normal unpacked extension, copy the extension id, then register the native host:

```bash
node apps/client/scripts/install-chrome-native-host.mjs <extension-id> <chrome|chromium|brave|edge> app
```

To test the extension against `pnpm tauri dev` while keeping the normal extension connected, load the generated `extensions/chrome-dev` folder as a second unpacked extension, copy its extension id, then register the dev host:

```bash
node apps/client/scripts/install-chrome-native-host.mjs <dev-extension-id> <chrome|chromium|brave|edge> dev
```

After first setup, keep `pnpm tauri dev` running, configure Settings > Doomscrolling > Browser in the app, keep Blacklist mode selected, start a Pomodoro focus session, and open a blocked website such as `reddit.com`.

For repeat testing:

- App UI changes usually hot reload through `pnpm tauri dev`.
- Rust command changes need `pnpm tauri dev` restarted.
- Native host changes need `pnpm -w run build:native-host`.
- Extension HTML, CSS, JS, manifest, or icon changes need the reload button on the extension card in the browser's extensions page.
- Doomscrolling mode, category, or website list changes are picked up by already open browser tabs on the next extension state poll.
- Removing and adding the unpacked extension gives it a new id, so the native host registration command must be run again.

### Build

```bash
cd apps/client
pnpm tauri build            # produces platform-specific installer
```

### Tests

```bash
pnpm -w run check      # types, Svelte diagnostics, Rust formatting, and clippy
pnpm -w run test       # Vitest and cargo tests
pnpm -w run validate   # full local validation gate
pnpm --dir apps/client test:watch
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but keep in mind:

- The app is in heavy early development. Architecture, APIs, and data models are still changing.
- Primary desktop testing uses **Ubuntu Linux** and **Windows 10**, with Android physical-device validation in progress. macOS and iOS builds remain untested because Apple build hardware and signing are not available.
- If you are considering a large change, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- Before contributing, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Participation in project spaces is governed by the [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Please report security vulnerabilities privately through the process in [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md), not through public issues.
