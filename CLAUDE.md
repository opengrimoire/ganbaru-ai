# GanbaruAI

GanbaruAI is a free, open-source (AGPL 3.0), privacy-first, local-first productivity app for desktop and mobile built with Tauri v2, Svelte 5, and Rust. It unifies a gamified calendar, Kanban board, Pomodoro system, note-taking, real-life skill tree, sleep alarm, daily diary, procrastination stopper, music player, work environment management, and project management into one interconnected experience wrapped in an adventure RPG aesthetic with a structurally integrated experience system (Will, Contracts, Consistency, Streaks).

## Key conventions

- **Package manager:** pnpm
- **Monorepo orchestration:** Turborepo on top of pnpm workspaces
- **Frontend:** plain Svelte 5 with runes (not SvelteKit)
- **Desktop/mobile shell:** Tauri v2
- **License:** AGPL 3.0 for the app, LGPL 2.1 for the media player plugin
- **Database:** SQLite via tauri-plugin-sql
- **Note format:** markdown files on disk (Tiptap editor)
- **State management:** Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect), no external state manager
- **Sync:** Yjs + Hocuspocus (CRDT-based, E2E encrypted, self-hosted by the user)
- **Build tool:** Vite (default with Tauri + Svelte scaffold)

## Rules

- Read PROGRESS.md at the start of every conversation to understand what has been done and what is in progress.
- After every session where files are created, modified, or deleted, update PROGRESS.md before finishing. PROGRESS.md is a current-state board, not a history log (git has the history). Maintenance rules:
  - When something is completed, move it from "Active work" to "What exists" as a brief line.
  - When a full phase is complete, collapse its "What exists" items into a single summary line and start the next phase.
  - When starting a new feature branch, add it to "Active work" with the branch name and scope.
  - "Blocked / needs decision" tracks anything that cannot proceed without input.
- When adding or modifying pure functions (utils, helpers, formulas), write or update unit tests. Tests live next to the source with `.test.ts` suffix. Run `pnpm test` from `apps/desktop/` to verify. Update TESTING.md if new test categories are added.
- Do not use em dashes or double dashes in markdown, code comments, or commit messages. Restructure sentences using periods, commas, colons, semicolons, or parentheses instead.
- This project is entirely donation-funded (GitHub Sponsors). Users never pay for a service and should never depend on infrastructure we host or maintain. Any feature involving external services (sync, backups, AI, integrations) must be designed so the user provisions and hosts it themselves. Prioritize ease of setup: provide step-by-step guides accessible to non-technical users, support multiple provider options (or the most common ones), and ask me for clarification on which providers to target if not already specified in the roadmap.
- Keep the workspace structure in this file up to date. When directories are created, renamed, or removed, update the tree and remove or add the (planned) marker as needed.
- When stuck on a framework-specific issue that you cannot resolve confidently from training knowledge, search the official documentation before attempting workarounds or guessing. Primary sources:
  - Tauri v2: v2.tauri.app
  - Svelte 5: svelte.dev/docs
  - shadcn-svelte: next.shadcn-svelte.com
  - Bits UI: bits-ui.com
  - Tailwind CSS v4: tailwindcss.com/docs
  - Tiptap: tiptap.dev/docs
  - If the official docs are not enough, fall back to general web searches (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, etc.).
