# Sync engine decisions

**Status: Reference.** Recorded 2026-10-09, when Quick notes became the first replicated domain. This record explains why concurrent sync is built the way it is. The contract is owned by [Device linking and synchronization](../../data/sync.md), merge semantics by [Sync merge rules](../../algorithms/sync/README.md), and the engine tables by [Sync schema](../../data/schema/sync.md).

## Constraints

- SQLite stays the source of truth. Domain tables hold the materialized current state, and the engine adds metadata beside them; it is never a parallel store the UI reads.
- Saves are local and immediate, and every write path must replicate, including imports, restores, scheduled jobs, and native background writes.
- Applying the same set of valid operations in any causal order must give byte-identical state, conflicts, and recovery entries. Nothing is silently lost.
- No project-operated infrastructure. LAN linking needs no server, and a later relay must store only opaque encrypted records.
- Operations carry a space, a person-certified writer, an authorization revision, and a key epoch from the start, so multi-person spaces later are a configuration of the same engine rather than a redesign.

## Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger-based capture plus sealing, not explicit per-command operations | Capture triggers are attached to the schema and commit atomically with the change, so coverage is complete by construction. A conformance test fails when the triggers differ from the manifest. |
| Seal from current row values with field-group masks | Rapid edits coalesce, operation content always matches the causal context it is signed with, and no pre-image logging is needed. Local captures are sealed before any remote operation applies in the same database. |
| Explicit classification of every table and column in a Rust manifest | Unknown data fails closed. Table and field ids are stable and never reused, and validation of an operation is a pure function of its bytes and manifest version. |
| Multi-value registers with version vectors | A write supersedes exactly the versions its author had seen. Concurrent versions stay as alternatives, which gives order independence and loss-free conflicts without a global order or a server. |
| Hybrid logical clock only as a display tie breaker | Clock skew can change which concurrent value is shown, never what is superseded or kept. |
| Installation-scoped writer keys certified by the person key | Reinstalls and restores get fresh writers, a durable sequence reservation detects restored or copied databases, the hub detects disk clones as forks, and future people's writers use the same trust path. |
| Hand-written, bounded, big-endian binary codec in the contracts crate | Signatures need exact bytes, and serde formats do not guarantee a canonical encoding across versions. It matches the contact card codec and adds no dependency. Golden vectors and mutation tests pin the format. |
| Value hashes in the signed header, values in an unsigned body | Later compaction can drop superseded values without breaking signature verification. |
| Variable-length string order keys with a row id tie breaker | Concurrent moves never require rebalancing other rows, and byte comparison matches SQLite `BINARY` ordering. |
| Mixed mode with connection-scoped guard triggers | Each domain converts when ready while unconverted data stays single-writer and safe. Guards live only on the connection, so they never travel in a snapshot. |
| Star topology through the coordinator desktop | Revocation cutoffs and fork detection are deterministic without consensus because every operation passes one point. A relay later becomes another hub, which requires redesigning revocation first. |
| Single connection per vault pool | Capture suppression during apply and the seal-then-apply order rely on nothing interleaving inside an engine transaction. Raising the pool size requires redesigning capture suppression first. |

## Rejected alternatives

- **cr-sqlite:** a native loadable extension (unsafe loading and native code in every process) with column-level last-writer-wins semantics and no support for surfaced conflicts, coupled values, order keys, or recovery.
- **Automerge or Loro as the canonical store:** conflicts with SQLite as the source of truth and would duplicate every domain model. Loro remains a reference for tree and list algorithms.
- **Server-authoritative engines (Replicache, PowerSync, Electric, Zero):** require project-operated or always-on servers and centralize authority.
- **Hocuspocus as relay:** persists plaintext Yjs documents server-side, breaking the encrypted record boundary.
- **Serde formats (postcard, CBOR, JSON) for signed operations:** no canonical byte guarantee across versions.
- **Explicit per-domain operation code without capture:** coverage depends on every write path remembering to emit, including imports, restores, scheduled jobs, and native background writes, and a missed path silently diverges replicas.
- **Whole-row last-writer-wins:** loses concurrent edits to different fields and hides conflicts.

## Accepted limitations

- Operations are plaintext at rest inside the vault, like the rest of the vault, until per-space encryption exists.
- Every linked device holds the person key, so a revoked device could still certify a new writer; the hub refuses revoked devices at TLS, and key separation is planned with encryption.
- Android writer keys use app-private files until Android Keystore wrapping exists.
- The operation log and retained state grow until causal stability and compaction exist.
- Linked devices must run the same protocol version, which is acceptable before external users.
