# UI foundations

Status: Implemented. This document owns the shared look and behavior of panels, menus, dialogs, rows, fields, and form controls. Feature docs describe what a panel contains; this document describes how every panel is built.

## Why

Panels were restyled one at a time, so radii, shadows, text sizes, input styles, and hover rules drifted apart in small ways that add up. One set of tokens and primitives keeps the app feeling like one product, and lets a single change reach every panel. Database collection panels are the reference design.

## Where it lives

- `apps/client/src/ui-foundations.css` defines the tokens and Tailwind utilities below.
- `apps/client/src/lib/components/ui/` holds the shared components: `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `SwitchField`, `Select`, `SearchField`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ActionToast`, and the tooltip host.
- `apps/client/src/lib/components/ui/floating-width.ts` mirrors the width utilities for positioning code.
- `apps/client/src/lib/utils/scroll-edge-fade.ts` and `apps/client/src/lib/utils/menu-aim.ts` own scroll fades and hover-submenu behavior.

## Surfaces

| Utility | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `surface-floating` | Menus, popovers, pickers, hover cards, and nonmodal panels |
| `surface-dialog` | Modal dialogs and large windows such as Settings |
| `surface-backdrop` | The dimmed layer behind a modal dialog |
| `surface-floating-body` | The inset between a floating surface and its rows |

- Every floating surface and dialog shares one radius, one thin border, and one barely visible shadow. Do not add `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`, rings, or other radii next to them.
- Rows and fields use the concentric item radius (`rounded-floating-item`), so inner corners follow the panel corner.
- Fullscreen and sheet variants on narrow or mobile layouts may drop the radius and border where they touch the screen edge.
- Floating surfaces use the `popover` color; dialogs use the `card` color. Do not add `dark:` background overrides; themes own those colors.

## Rows and text

- `menu-item` is the actionable row: it carries the panel row height, padding, gap, radius, icon size, hover, keyboard focus, and disabled styling. `menu-item-destructive` marks a row that removes data.
- `menu-separator` divides groups, and `menu-label` titles a group.
- Background highlight marks only the pointer, keyboard focus, and the row whose submenu is open (`aria-expanded="true"`). The current choice shows a trailing check, never a persistent background. Menus that keep DOM focus elsewhere, such as an editor, mark the keyboard-active row with `data-highlighted`.
- Panel text uses `text-panel`, set by the surface, and secondary text (descriptions, shortcuts, counts, group labels) uses `text-panel-detail`. Avoid ad hoc rem sizes inside panels.
- Touch layouts raise the row height to a 44px target through `--panel-row-height`; do not add separate mobile row heights.

## Fields and controls

- `field` styles a text input, textarea, or a wrapper that holds a borderless `field-bare` input with icons. Fields are transparent with a thin border; `aria-invalid="true"` on the input marks an error border that stays while focused.
- Text entry never shows a focus contour, ring, border change, or fill; the caret is enough. The global keyboard focus outline excludes text entry for the same reason. Buttons, checkboxes, and switches keep the keyboard focus outline.
- Checkboxes use `ui/Checkbox`, a native input drawn with theme tokens. Use `indeterminate` for partly selected parents, and wrap it in a `<label>` with visible text when the label is visible.
- On and off settings use `ui/Switch` or `ui/SwitchField`. Inside floating panels the switch uses its `compact` size so it sits within the panel row. A switch that saves quickly stays enabled while saving and ignores repeated presses instead, so the cursor and colors do not flash. Choices from a list use `ui/Select`, never a native `<select>`, so menus match the rest of the app.

## Widths

- Floating surfaces use `w-floating-sm` (compact action menus), `w-floating` (settings and option panels), or `w-floating-lg` (searchable lists, editors, and two-part rows), capped by the viewport. Content that genuinely needs another width, such as a calendar grid or an editor, may use its own.

## Scrolling

- Every scrollable panel body fades the edge that has more content beyond it with `scrollEdgeFadeAction`.
- The fade is a mask, so put it on an inner scroll element, never on the bordered surface, or the border and background fade too.

## Hover submenus

- In a menu, a hovered row opens its submenu after `SUBMENU_OPEN_DELAY_MS` and a hover-opened submenu closes `SUBMENU_CLOSE_DELAY_MS` after the pointer leaves both, unless the pointer is aiming at it within `SUBMENU_AIM_TOLERANCES`.
- Cascading pickers and settings flyouts, whose side panel stays open until dismissed, switch to a hovered row immediately unless the pointer is aiming at the open panel within `SUBMENU_AIM_TOLERANCES`.
- The parent row keeps `aria-expanded="true"` and its highlight while the submenu is open. Opening one submenu closes its siblings.
- ArrowRight or Enter opens a submenu from the keyboard, and ArrowLeft or Escape returns to the parent row.

## Deliberate exceptions

- The Calendar event panel family (event panel, recurrence, notifications, and description editor surfaces) keeps its own shape, color, and shadow.
- Tooltips use an inverted palette so they read as transient hints rather than panels.
- Calendar-colored pickers (icon picker, event and quick note color pickers) keep the Calendar background so they match the surface that opens them, while sharing the radius and shadow.
- The settings panels opened from the Projects, Notes, and Chat toolbars keep their own section order and layout inside shared chrome.

New exceptions need a product reason recorded here.
