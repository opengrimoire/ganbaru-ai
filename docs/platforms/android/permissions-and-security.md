# Android permissions and security

Android requests access in context, only after the user enables a feature that needs it. Denial, revocation, or unavailable system support leaves a truthful state and direct recovery action.

## Permission plan

| Access | Purpose | Denied behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notification runtime permission | Calendar reminders, Pomodoro state, Music media, and selected-app explanations on Android 13 or newer | Feature remains usable without delivery; settings explain how to enable notifications later. |
| Exact alarm special access | Precise Calendar focus reminders and documented deadline cases on Android 12 or newer | Use the documented inexact idle-aware fallback and explain that delivery can be late. |
| Foreground service declarations | Active Pomodoro and Media3 playback | Service-backed background behavior is unavailable when the corresponding feature cannot start truthfully. |
| Usage Access | Count explicitly selected packages and reconcile selected-app limits | No Android usage counting or limit enforcement; configuration remains readable. |
| Accessibility Service | Observe selected package transitions and perform Home for matching rules | No selected-app blocking; usage counting may remain if Usage Access is granted. |
| Document tree and file grants | Import, restore, selected Music tree, and managed files | Only the selected action fails; no broad storage fallback is requested. |
| Camera runtime permission | Scan a desktop pairing QR code while the user is on the linking screen | Linking remains available later from Data settings; no image or video is stored. |

## Special-access disclosure

Usage Access and Accessibility have separate localized disclosures immediately before opening system settings. Each states what is observed, what is not observed, the action performed, and that access can be revoked.

Returning from settings refreshes actual platform state. Manufacturer autostart settings have no reliable enabled query, so the app records only that the user reviewed the page and never displays a false granted state.

## Accessibility boundary

The Doomscrolling service requests only the event stream needed to identify package window changes. It does not retrieve view content, text, gestures, keystrokes, notifications, screen images, or arbitrary browsing data.

Enforcement uses the standard Home global action for a fresh explicitly selected package. It does not use overlays, gesture injection, screen capture, or device-owner authority.

This capability requires store-policy review and the appropriate Play declaration before release.

## Package visibility

The app uses targeted launchable-activity queries needed for the on-demand selected-app picker. It does not request `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`.

Unknown packages, system UIDs, Ganbaru AI, Home, Settings, dialer, and protected apps are rejected.

## Storage authority

The app does not request `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or legacy broad shared-storage access. Live vault data stays application-private. System pickers grant only user-selected inputs and destinations.

Persisted document permissions are retained only for sources that require ongoing access, such as the selected Music tree.

## Other excluded permissions

Current features do not request contacts, microphone, location, screen capture, system overlay, device-owner status, or VPN consent. Android exposes one camera permission for camera capture, so it cannot be narrowed to a separate still-photo-only permission. Ganbaru AI requests it only when the QR scanner is shown, requests no microphone access, processes preview frames in memory, and stops the stream after a code is decoded or the scanner closes. A future feature requires a new spec, localized disclosure, denial behavior, tests, and policy review before new authority enters the manifest.

## WebView and bridge

The mobile capability grants only commands required by shared features and Android adapters. It does not expose a generic filesystem, process, shell, network, or event capability.

Untrusted file and native responses are validated before becoming typed frontend state. External URL opening is limited to supported safe schemes and explicit user action. Production content policy does not allow arbitrary remote script or image authority.

## Native component exposure

Services, receivers, providers, and activities are non-exported unless an operating-system integration requires exposure. Internal broadcasts use an app-signature permission. Notification taps and document results are validated before routing.

## Secrets

Android currently does not run local provider processes. Future sync or remote execution credentials require a native credential boundary and must not be stored in the vault or frontend configuration.

## Failure behavior

Permission loss never widens access or falls back to a broader permission. Native projections expire or fail safe, selected-app blocking stops when authority or state is stale, and canonical data remains available to unaffected local features.
