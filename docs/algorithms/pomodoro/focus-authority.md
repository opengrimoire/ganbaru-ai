# Focus authority and evidence

**Status: Partial.** A native owner on desktop and Android drives admission, transactional execution, adaptive decisions, recovery, and accepted-phase publication. Physical platform acceptance remains open. Linked-device ownership, remote commands, and live companion status are planned.

## Independent facts

A commitment is a Calendar plan. An executing run is an accepted interval with persisted state. Activity is an observation from an authorized local source or an explicit user confirmation. Freshness describes when a remote response was received. None implies the others.

A timer measures an accepted interval; it does not prove productive work. Calendar projections, phone backgrounding, screen-off time, and silence from another device are not activity evidence.

## Admission

- Desktop automatic starts require an eligible Calendar event and a new native activity observation showing input at or after the event boundary and no older than 15 seconds. Missing, malformed, future, or stale observations cannot authorize execution. While a due commitment waits for activity, the owner rechecks every 15 seconds. Manual start remains available when the source is unavailable.
- Android starts only through explicit user action. Calendar alarms carry reminder data only, never a run ID, phase plan, or running flag. Permission denial never starts a session.
- A run publishes running state only after its initial write commits. A failed write leaves no executing timer. A late start uses its actual acceptance time.
- A finished break waiting for return is not an accepted phase. Waiting for any duration cannot start focus; the user must accept the return ("Ready to return").

Rationale: without these rules, a phone alarm or a desktop that was off at event start could fabricate focus history and drive Doomscrolling or Music as if the user were working.

## Native owner

`ganbaru-focus` owns admission, transitions, pauses, recovery, history, and adaptive boundary decisions. The Tauri app runs one serialized native owner per active vault (`pomodoro/native_runtime`). Svelte never runs execution timers or writes runs, segments, pauses, or adaptive rows; it sends semantic commands and paints accepted snapshots. Android lifecycle observations come from Kotlin without needing a WebView.

- Every command carries an ID. An accepted command stores an immutable receipt in the same transaction as its effects, so retries return the committed result instead of executing again. A later stopped run cannot be replaced by an earlier receipt.
- User actions are bound to the revision shown when the user clicked. Stale revisions are rejected; they never postpone execution deadlines.
- Outgoing and incoming phases, the adaptive decision, and the receipt commit in one transaction. Failed timezone resolution, evidence admission, or persistence rejects the operation without publishing execution.
- The Calendar configuration and the adaptively selected rhythm stay separate, so a policy change cannot masquerade as a Calendar reconfiguration. Accepted phase durations are fixed; only a later boundary can select another rhythm.
- Presentation subscriptions carry compact revision and availability notices, are bound to the invoking window, are limited to eight, and expire after 30 seconds without renewal. Reading presentation never admits a run.

## Recovery

Recovery reads canonical SQLite state only, never a notification projection, and repeated recovery creates no new history.

- **Desktop:** an open run found at startup closes as interrupted at its last heartbeat, bounded by the event end. Heartbeats are written every 15 seconds while a run is open.
- **Android:** a previously committed phase and its pauses resume when still valid. A phase whose deadline passed completes at that deadline and enters return wait. An elapsed event expires the run. Recorded time never exceeds the accepted phase deadline.

Rationale: desktop crashes leave no trustworthy evidence of what happened after the last heartbeat, whereas Android routinely suspends JavaScript while the committed native phase remains valid.

## Cross-feature effects

Notifications, overlays, tray, sounds, Music, Doomscrolling, and Android Guardian are effects of committed state, never inputs to it.

- Effects carry the Focus publication generation and the shared vault ownership generation, and are rechecked against current native authority immediately before delivery. Superseded, stopped, or different-run effects are dropped.
- Effect validity is a monotonic lease (15 seconds) clipped to the accepted phase and event deadlines. Return wait, failed, stopped, and expired phases cannot authorize phase-dependent rules.
- Effect delivery runs in a separate worker that coalesces to the latest request. A slow or failing platform operation never delays execution; it retries with its own backoff and reports a pending-delivery diagnostic.
- Android notifications describe only the current accepted phase. At its deadline they remind the user to return; they cannot advance to another phase. Alarm and committed-completion delivery share one receipt so a boundary alert fires once.
- On Android, the Guardian service accepts a phase only after checking current native authority through an app-private, read-only provider bound to the Rust process identity, so an old process cannot overwrite newer state.

## Vault lifecycle

Vault selection, replacement, and handoff freeze the native owner before closing pools, using the shared [vault operation boundary](../../data/architecture.md). Freeze immediately revokes effect admission, waits up to ten seconds for the owner and five seconds for the delivery worker, and fails quiescence on timeout instead of abandoning work. Lifecycle revisions prevent an earlier freeze or resume from overriding a later one. After resume, idle warnings must be shown and acknowledged again.

## Idle grace

Idle failure is measured from the first committed visibility acknowledgement of the current warning, using the owner's monotonic clock. Missing visibility or a failed acknowledgement write cannot consume the user's grace period. See [Idle detection](idle-detection.md).

## Planned: device controller ownership

A linked vault will have one explicitly selected focus controller, defaulting to the pairing desktop. This is separate from coordination among windows on one device. Disconnection never elects a replacement; the current controller may continue offline. An unlinked phone supports explicit local sessions.

A live handoff must:

1. Commit final state and fence further execution under the old ownership epoch.
2. Issue a transfer identifying the recipient and checkpoint.
3. Persist the transfer on the recipient before it executes.
4. Retry the same transfer after lost acknowledgements without reactivating the old controller.

Lost-device recovery creates a new generation. Records recovered from the old generation remain historical evidence and receive overlap review. Remote commands require command ID, ownership epoch, expected run revision, and expiry. Only an acknowledged committed result is success; expired commands cannot run after reconnection. Replication must never cause native execution.

## Planned: companion freshness

Live status uses a separate connection from durable replication. During an active companion connection, heartbeats run every 15 seconds and status expires after 45 seconds without a fresh response, measured with local monotonic time and connection generations rather than peer clocks.

When status expires, show the last confirmed state and "Status unavailable." Do not infer focus, idle, failure, or completed phases. Cached deadlines may produce clearly labeled scheduled reminders only. Phone activity does not reset the desktop idle clock or override webcam suppression and source failures. Phase-dependent Music and Doomscrolling consume confirmed state with bounded validity, and Android background restrictions appear as degraded connectivity.
