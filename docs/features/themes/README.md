# Themes

Themes define Ganbaru AI's application shell, Calendar surfaces, event palette, and contrast behavior through a validated registry. A theme is not a light/dark boolean.

## Current scope

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Immutable built-in light and dark themes | Implemented |
| User themes with full resolved snapshots and source palettes | Implemented |
| Import, export, duplicate, edit, seed reset, and engine rebake | Implemented |
| Stable 32-slot event palette | Implemented |
| Live preview, token isolation, contrast warnings, and responsive editor | Implemented |
| Font family and scale preferences | Implemented |

## Principles

- Stored event colors use stable slot identities, not copied hex values.
- Paint uses stored resolved snapshots, so engine upgrades never silently change a user theme.
- Source edits derive coherent token families without erasing isolated (user-pinned) values.
- Effective canvas luminance, not the theme's name or label, decides runtime light or dark treatment.
- Contrast feedback is visible and honest; the app never certifies an inaccessible palette.
- Imported themes cannot shadow built-in identities.
- Save and Cancel have complete snapshot semantics.

## Theme model

A theme contains:

- Stable identity and display name.
- Resolved app and Calendar token snapshots.
- Source colors used by the [color engine](color-engine.md).
- Per-token isolation flags.
- A 32-slot event palette plus fallback slot and blend canvas.
- Calendar default basis.
- Derivation engine version.

## Token catalog

The editable catalog is defined by `APP_TOKEN_KEYS` and `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEYS` in `apps/client/src/lib/stores/themes/definitions.ts`, currently 36 app tokens and 7 Calendar tokens. Token identities are the compatibility contract; the counts are only a current fact.

User themes store every editable token as a resolved hex snapshot. Runtime-only implementation colors (hover tints, borders, and similar paint details) are derived from stored values and are never exported or shown as editable rows. Add a new editable token only for a stable, user-meaningful color decision; see the theme token rules in `AGENTS.md`.

Adding, renaming, or removing an editable token requires, in the same change:

- A value for each built-in theme.
- Upgrade behavior for stored user themes and their seeds, with an explicit drop or mapping rule so dead values do not linger.
- Import and export validation.
- Editor placement.
- SQLite migration or cleanup.
- Tests, and an update to this section.

## Event palette

Every theme owns exactly 32 event-color slots with stable numeric identity. Calendar events and Quick notes store the slot index, so switching themes recolors them without rewriting records. Unknown slot values fall back to the theme's fallback slot. Reordering visible color controls never renumbers persisted slots. The blend canvas controls dimmed event variants and normally follows the Calendar canvas unless isolated.

## Persistence

User themes and their seed snapshots are normalized SQLite records. Built-in light and dark themes are code-pinned, never stored as rows, and their reserved IDs cannot be inserted by import or persistence. Unknown active IDs fall back to the default built-in.

The active theme ID, quick-toggle light and dark choices, font family, and font scale are portable preferences in active-vault `config.json`; theme content never lives there. Platform bootstraps load configuration and hydrate user themes before mounting the app shell.

A user theme keeps a seed snapshot for `Reset all to seed`. Duplicating creates a new independent seed, and import uses the imported content as its seed. Seeds are not exported.

## Import and export

Export is deterministic, versioned JSON (`schemaVersion: 1`) with identity, snapshots, sources, isolation, event palette, Calendar defaults, blend canvas, and engine version, without device-local selection preferences.

Import validates the whole object before registering it and never partially applies rows. Missing required values, invalid colors, malformed slots, or an unsupported schema version fail with a list of all problems. Unknown token keys are dropped so a stale token name does not block an otherwise valid theme. An ID that already exists, built-in or user, is rejected. Themes from an older engine paint from their snapshots and are offered a rebake.

## Typography and density

Font family and font scale are Appearance preferences, not theme tokens. They apply alongside the active theme but keep their own portable preference identity, so changing themes does not change reading comfort.

Layout density is not a theme dimension. A future density system needs explicit component and accessibility contracts rather than arbitrary spacing tokens in imported color themes.
