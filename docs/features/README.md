# Feature documentation

Feature documents describe intended product behavior and the reasons behind it. They are normative unless a section is explicitly labeled as current implementation status. Status labels (Implemented, Partial, Planned, Deferred) follow the [documentation status vocabulary](../README.md#status-language).

Source paths, schema inventories, cache tuning, device test matrices, and delivery history belong in architecture, data, performance, testing, or roadmap documentation. Feature specs keep security bounds and limits when those bounds affect user expectations or protect durable data.

## Planned product surfaces

- [Diary](diary.md)
- [Edge panel](edge-panel.md)
- [Sleep alarm](sleep-alarm.md)
- [Work environments](work-environments.md)

## Deferred product surfaces

- [Gamification](gamification.md)

Platform-specific behavior lives under [platform documentation](../platforms/README.md). Data ownership and persistence rules live under [data documentation](../data/README.md). Pure logic that can be specified independently of UI or persistence lives under [algorithms](../algorithms/README.md).
