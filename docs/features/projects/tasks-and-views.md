# Project tasks and views

## Task model

A task has stable identity, project, section, optional parent task, title, description, status, priority, type, estimate, start and due dates with optional times, target end date, milestone state, blocker reason, dependencies, tags, custom values, archive state, and timestamps. Task assignees and reviewers are planned.

Subtasks are normal tasks with a parent. Checklist items are lighter completion records owned by one task. A parent and its descendants keep explicit states; completing a parent does not silently erase open child work.

The project header's add button opens task detail on an empty draft in the default section and status from any view. The draft offers the same sections as an existing task, but nothing is persisted until it is submitted with a title: the task is created first, then its checklist, subtasks, parent, tags, dependencies, scheduled blocks, and custom values are written against it, and any that fail are reported on the created task. Closing a changed draft asks before discarding it.

## Sections and ordering

Sections provide project-local organization. They can be created, renamed, reordered, collapsed, hidden, archived, and restored. Archiving a section never deletes its tasks.

Manual order is meaningful only in views and groups that use it; sorting or computed grouping never rewrites it. Moves are computed against the complete sibling order in native storage, not only the loaded view, so a move lands where the user asked even when other siblings are hidden. Custom fields and their options follow the same rule. Moves are atomic and retry-safe.

## Archive and restore

Archive is preferred to deletion when a task has history, scheduled blocks, dependencies, subtasks, Notes, or review context. Archiving a parent also archives its descendants, so active children never hide under an inactive parent, and restore follows the same closure. Archived tasks remain reachable through explicit filters and history.

## Selection and bulk actions

List and Kanban support multi-select with bulk completion, reopening, status, priority, archive, and restore. A bulk change commits the complete accepted selection and its history atomically. Missing tasks, mixed projects, or values that changed since selection reject the whole operation rather than silently skipping items. Archive and restore include descendants outside the loaded view, and a failed or uncertain response can be retried with the same operation identity.

## List

List is the default view. It shows section or computed groups, configurable columns, inline editing, selection, task creation, and horizontal access to wide schemas. It uses the [shared collection components](../collections.md); task property editors, section controls, subtasks, selection, and manual ordering stay project-specific.

Columns can include status, dates, priority, assignee, reviewer, estimate, schedule, dependencies, tags, and custom fields. Per project, users can show, hide, reorder, resize, wrap, and freeze columns, and choose display formats (date style, time style, number grouping or percent). Display choices never change stored values, query predicates, or sorting.

Column headers can insert a custom property beside the current column, rename it, and edit its options. Duplicating a property creates a new schema with fresh option identities and no copied values.

Column calculations (count, filled, empty, and for numeric columns sum, average, minimum, maximum) run over every task matched by the native query, not just the loaded page. Calculations never show totals from an older filter.

Conditional row colors use ordered project-local status or priority rules; the first matching rule tints the row.

Rows can group by section, status, priority, due-date bucket, or scheduled state. Computed groups are projections over the same tasks, and quick creation pre-fills a group value only when it maps safely to a canonical field.

## Kanban

Kanban groups cards by status and supports creation, movement, selection, and compact task metadata. Moving a card changes its status through the same validation as task detail. With manual sorting, cards can be reordered within a column; other sorts permit status changes without rewriting manual order. Card menus offer movement so drag is never required. A rejected move keeps the previous canonical position.

Hidden or archived statuses never make tasks disappear without an explicit filter or recovery path.

## Calendar

The project Calendar view shows events linked to the project. It reuses canonical Calendar events and task-event links rather than keeping a separate scheduling source of truth. Scheduling follows [Settings and scheduling](settings-and-scheduling.md#scheduling-tasks).

## Gantt

Gantt renders dated tasks and milestones on a proportional timeline with sections, today, overdue, blocked, done, dependencies, and finish-to-start conflict signals. Dragging and resizing propose date changes, and dependency repair follows [Dependency date proposals](settings-and-scheduling.md#dependency-date-proposals).

## Dashboard

Dashboard summarizes task counts, completion, open estimates, scheduled hours, blockers, deadlines, overdue work, unscheduled due tasks, missing estimates, and recent changes and completions. These are planning signals; they never become productivity scores, rankings, or automatic judgments.

## Saved views

A saved view captures the selected tab and its search, filters, sorting, visible columns, grouping, collapsed state, and archived visibility. It never snapshots task data, and deleting it does not change tasks.

## Task detail

Task detail is a focused editor available from every view. It edits a local draft, shows content (description, checklists, subtasks, dependencies, scheduled blocks, activity) beside an always-visible property column, and stacks them on narrow layouts. Unsaved closure uses the shared discard flow. Links to Calendar, Notes, Chat, files, and dependencies remain explicit and navigable.

## Accessibility and touch

All views provide keyboard routes for navigation, creation, editing, selection, bulk action, movement, and opening task detail. Drag always has a keyboard or menu alternative. Touch layouts use native two-axis panning for wide List and Gantt surfaces and never hide critical actions behind hover.
