# Shared collection views

Status: Implemented for the shared surfaces below.

Notes databases and Projects use one collection component family (`apps/client/src/lib/components/collections/`). Changes to shared rows, cells, resize handles, view buttons, floating panels, cards, inline creation, or Kanban interaction apply to both features. Shared components accept snippets and typed callbacks so each feature exposes its own properties and actions.

Rationale: the two features present the same kinds of collections, and one implementation keeps their interaction and visual rules from drifting apart.

## Domain boundaries

The shared UI does not import either feature's stores, invoke native commands, or own persisted data. Notes pages and properties remain Notes data; Projects tasks, statuses, priorities, scheduling, selection, and bulk actions remain Projects data. Each feature supplies only the operations it supports, and shared components never infer unsupported property operations or expose controls that cannot be saved safely.

Each feature owns its complete-result calculations and conditional rules; neither derives totals from a partially loaded row window.

Projects Calendar renders canonical Calendar events and task scheduling, while Notes Calendar renders date properties; their scheduling semantics remain distinct. Timeline and Gantt keep their own domain renderers.

## Tables

Rows share spacing, cell frames, focus treatment, and resize handles. Resizing works with pointer and keyboard; a failed width save restores the canonical width and shows the error. Notes persists widths in its saved database view; Projects keeps its own column sizing, automatic fit, task selection, subtasks, and grouped ordering.

Column headers show the icon of their value type, and both features share one icon per property kind. A header opens one shared column menu: an inline rename field at the top, then the property, query, display, placement, and duplication actions the feature supports. A rejected rename keeps the draft and shows the error. Properties are created directly on the table, from the trailing "+" control or the column menu's insert actions, with one shared creator: an optional name, then a searchable type grid grouped into sections. A blank name falls back to a unique name derived from the type. Choosing a type completes the action and closes the whole menu chain; the trailing creator keeps its name draft until a creation succeeds. In Notes, the column menu's Edit property row opens that property's settings beside the menu, with drafts saved explicitly. Project settings remain the place for full custom field configuration.

Inline creation differs by domain. Projects requires a task name before creating a task, and a failed write keeps the draft. Notes creates a real blank page immediately, since empty Notes titles are valid. Pending writes prevent duplicate submissions.

## Cards and Kanban

Boards share column widths, cards, inline creation per column, and secondary actions in a menu. Each feature provides menu actions for moving between groups so touch and keyboard users never need to drag.

The shared board owns drag state, drop feedback, pending state, and error feedback, and ignores unrelated external drags. Projects supplies status writes and manual ordering; sorted views permit group changes but not reordering within a column. Notes supplies its validated grouping-property writes and does not invent manual order. A failed write leaves the card in its canonical position. Gallery and Notes Calendar reuse the same card and action components.

## View controls and panels

Both features share view buttons and compact floating settings panels anchored to the invoking toolbar control. Opening settings leaves the collection visible and interactive. Panels fit the viewport, scroll only when content exceeds the available height, and stay inside an owning page preview when applicable.

Settings panels are navigable pages: rows show an icon, label, and current value, and selecting a row opens its detail page in the same popover. Back keeps drafts. Escape closes the innermost layer first, and explicit dismissal returns focus to the invoking control. Pointer menus stay compact while touch layouts use larger targets.

Rows inside a floating menu that lead to more options open a submenu beside that row instead of replacing the menu. A submenu is narrower than the menu it opens from and opens just right of its row, flips to the left when the right side lacks room, and opens below its row when neither side fits. Resting the mouse on a row opens its submenu without moving focus; moving to another row closes it after a short grace period unless focus is inside it, and only one sibling submenu is open at a time. Clicking the row or pressing ArrowRight moves focus into the submenu, and ArrowLeft or Escape returns to the row. Touch opens submenus by tap only.

Panels, column headers, and cell values, including select and status cells, share one collection text size derived from the Notes paragraph size and slightly smaller than it, so dense tables stay compact while headers match the rows beneath them; secondary captions such as field labels and counts stay smaller.
