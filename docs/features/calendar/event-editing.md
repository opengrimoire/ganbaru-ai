# Calendar event editing

## Event fields

A local event can contain:

- An optional plain-text title.
- Timed start and end instants with a home zone, or an all-day date range.
- One of 32 stable event-color slots.
- Sanitized rich description content.
- Zero or more notification offsets.
- Calendar identity, visibility, free/busy state, status, and imported metadata.
- Optional meeting location, call link, organizer, and attendee metadata.
- Optional project, task links, Pomodoro configuration, idle behavior, and music assignments.
- An optional recurrence rule and preserved interoperability data.

The data documentation owns exact columns and limits. The editor communicates user-visible limits before save and retains unsupported imported material through the interoperability preservation boundary when possible.

## Create and edit flow

Clicking or dragging an empty time range creates a draft and opens the event panel. A newly created all-day event starts from a date selection. The draft may remain untitled.

The panel groups time, calendar, project, focus, music, meeting, description, recurrence, and notification controls without requiring every group for a simple event. Save validates one coherent draft. Closing a dirty panel requests discard confirmation.

Editing an existing event opens from the rendered occurrence. Recurring events use the scoped behavior in [Recurrence editing](recurrence-editing.md).

Existing-event Save, immediate drag saves, End now, and Enable Focus use native semantic commands. Calendar mutations and their Focus changes commit together. End now uses the native acceptance clock. A lost reply leaves an unresolved Save notice with Retry, retaining the original request even if the Calendar view closes. Retrying resolves that request; a newer draft cannot replace it. A failed visible-window refresh keeps the panel open and can reuse the accepted receipt.

Pending saves disable mutation controls. Failed or deferred saves retain edited Music assignments instead of treating them as saved. Closing a panel or selecting another event does not authorize a delayed confirmation to save that newly selected event.

## Project and task linkage

The project selector shows active groups and projects, not the project's entire task tree. Selecting a project can fill an empty title from the project's default event name and applies compatible defaults to a non-active draft. It never replaces an existing title.

Project defaults can include color, duration, Pomodoro mode, idle behavior, and phase soundtrack assignments. Active event edits do not apply a duration default because changing projects must not resize work already in progress.

Tasks link through explicit task-event link records. Links require the task and event to belong to the same project. Unlinking does not delete either record.

## Meeting metadata

Locally authored events can edit location, call link, organizer metadata, and attendees. Imported organizer and attendee identities remain read-only until Ganbaru AI can prove the current user's identity and write permission.

The app never changes another attendee's response based only on a displayed email or label. Local response metadata may drive local rendering without becoming external attendee data.

## Notifications

Notifications use native platform delivery. Each reminder identifies the event, lead time, interval or all-day state, and location when available. Tapping a notification opens the relevant Calendar context.

Desktop schedules while the app runtime is available and catches up within a bounded interval after resume. Android maintains a bounded native projection so reminders can fire while the WebView and Rust runtime are absent. See [Android permissions and security](../../platforms/android/permissions-and-security.md).

## Status and visual meaning

Event color remains the selected palette slot. Optional dimming of past events is a presentation preference. Free/busy is scheduling metadata, not a decorative pattern.

Cancelled or declined events use a pattern and text treatment in addition to color. Accepted, tentative, pending, and declined response rendering is used only when a matching local identity or explicit local response exists.

## Active-session protection

An event with an active Pomodoro run cannot be deleted, archived, moved, retimed from the start, or structurally changed in a way that detaches the active run without an explicit safe plan. The primary action is to end the event or stop the run first.

Edits that materialize a recurring active occurrence transfer run and segment references atomically. Historical timer records are never restarted or rewritten to imitate an undo.

## Coordination and capacity

Calendar conflict detection is advisory. Overlap is permitted because meetings, travel, parallel reminders, and all-day context can legitimately coexist. Capacity views explain conflicts and insufficient time without silently moving commitments.

Any future automatic scheduling presents a proposal before mutation and preserves explicit user locks, dependencies, protected history, and working-hour preferences.

## Import and export

iCalendar behavior, loss boundaries, recurrence, timezone handling, merge policy, and conformance fixtures are canonical under [iCalendar interoperability](../../interop/icalendar/README.md). This feature document defines the user editing surface and does not duplicate the complete standard projection.
