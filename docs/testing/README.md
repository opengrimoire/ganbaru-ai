# Testing

Ganbaru AI uses layered validation across the Svelte frontend, Rust workspace, SQLite persistence, browser extension, Android project, production bundles, and dependency graph.

This document is the command and gate-selection reference. Supporting documents cover:

- [Validation infrastructure](validation-infrastructure.md): ordering, resource limits, caching, bundle contracts, and topology changes.
- [Test authoring](test-authoring.md): useful frontend, Rust, SQLite, authorization, and UI tests.
- [Android acceptance](android.md): physical-device, emulator, permission, lifecycle, and release cases.
- [Local vault handoff](vault-handoff.md): concise physical desktop and Android round-trip acceptance and result record.
- [Calendar recurrence](calendar-recurrence.md): recurrence editing and interoperability matrices.
- [Notes editor](notes-editor.md): editor, database, transfer, and recovery matrices.
- [Performance harness](../performance/harness.md): benchmark-only contracts outside normal validation.

## Goals

Validation should protect durable user data and security boundaries, catch behavior and build regressions, preserve platform portability, and remain predictable on resource-constrained machines.

Test count and coverage percentage are not quality targets. Coverage follows product risk, state complexity, interoperability, and the cost of failure.

## Validation layers

- **Frontend tests:** Vitest tests next to source, using Node by default and jsdom only for real DOM behavior.
- **Rust tests:** domain, persistence, provider, platform, migration, transaction, recovery, and command-boundary tests in the owning crate.
- **Static checks:** Svelte Check, TypeScript, Rust formatting, Clippy, provider protocol snapshots, and Tailwind diagnostics.
- **Production bundle contracts:** real Vite builds that verify route closures, source-module ceilings, platform composition, and forbidden eager imports.
- **Android project and build contracts:** generated-project policy, isolated Android frontend graph, and an independent ARM64 pull request build.
- **Dependency audits:** pnpm advisories and RustSec, with reviewed Rust exceptions documented under [dependency audits](../data/security/dependency-audits.md).
- **Manual platform acceptance:** real Tauri and Android behavior that automated tests cannot represent faithfully.

## Root commands

Always use the workspace flag for root scripts.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm -w run check` | Rust formatting and Clippy, then Svelte and TypeScript checks |
| `pnpm -w run test` | Rust tests, then normal frontend tests in four sequential shards |
| `pnpm -w run test:benchmark-contracts` | Explicit benchmark fixture and harness contracts, excluded from normal validation |
| `pnpm -w run editor-check` | Tailwind editor-style diagnostics |
| `pnpm -w run bundle-contracts` | Desktop and Android production-build contracts |
| `pnpm -w run audit` | pnpm and Rust dependency audits |
| `pnpm -w run validate` | Complete normal code gate |
| `pnpm -w run validate:ci` | The same gate with two Cargo build jobs for the hosted Linux runner |
| `pnpm -w run validate:full` | Dependency audits followed by the normal code gate |

`validate` is the normal comprehensive gate. `validate:full` is required for dependency or lockfile changes, security-sensitive dependency work, releases, and explicit full-security requests.

The hosted `linux validation` pull request workflow runs `validate:ci`, including the same static checks, tests, editor diagnostics, and bundle contracts as local `validate`. Only Cargo compilation uses two jobs instead of one. Rust tests still use one test thread, and the frontend shards remain sequential and single-worker. The independent Android job builds an ARM64 debug APK, while the Windows job checks Rust composition without producing an installer.

## Choosing a gate

Start with the narrowest command that can catch a plausible regression.

### Focused frontend behavior

```sh
pnpm --dir apps/client exec vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts --maxWorkers=1
```

Confirm that Vitest reports only the requested files. Stop and correct the command if the full suite starts.

### Focused Rust behavior

```sh
cargo test -p ganbaru-chat --lib -j 1 test_name -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p ganbaru-notes --lib -j 1 test_name -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p ganbaru-db --lib -j 1 test_name -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p ganbaru-tauri-app --lib -j 1 test_name -- --test-threads=1
```

Substitute `ganbaru-chat-contracts`, `ganbaru-chat-providers`, `ganbaru-focus`, or `ganbaru-working-folders` when that crate owns the behavior.

Use the native messaging binary only for binary-local tests:

```sh
cargo test -p ganbaru-native-messaging --bin ganbaru-ai-native-messaging -j 1 test_name -- --test-threads=1
```

Check desktop composition after changing a core crate or Tauri adapter:

```sh
cargo check -p ganbaru-ai --bin ganbaru-ai -j 1
```

### Focused static feedback

```sh
pnpm --dir apps/client run check
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace -j 1 -- -D warnings
pnpm -w run editor-check
```

### Small UI and documentation changes

Do not run the complete gate solely because a small UI or documentation edit is finished. Use static checks when Svelte, TypeScript, Tailwind, or shared UI structure can be affected. Add focused tests when behavior changes.

Mechanically obvious prose, copy, or link changes need no code validation unless a workflow requires it.

### Data-sensitive changes

Backend persistence, SQLite, import, export, migrations, membership, note saving, and other data-loss-sensitive changes require focused tests during implementation and a broader completion gate proportional to risk.

Tests must consider existing installs, stale rows, unknown values, older exports, rollback, partial failure, idempotency, and cleanup of obsolete data.

### Pull requests and releases

Run `pnpm -w run validate` before a normal pull request and before other risk-sensitive integration work. Run `pnpm -w run validate:full` when dependencies, lockfiles, audits, release security, or explicit instructions require it.

If a batch already passed the required gate, do not repeat it unless later changes materially affect covered behavior.

## Execution constraints

Broad root scripts intentionally serialize Rust and frontend work. Do not start Cargo, Vitest, Svelte Check, Turbo, or another broad validation command while `check`, `test`, `validate`, or `validate:full` is active.

Focused Cargo commands use one build job and one test thread. Focused Vitest uses one worker. Do not increase broad concurrency, combine Rust and frontend stages, or remove sharding without measuring peak memory and confirming unchanged coverage.

See [Validation infrastructure](validation-infrastructure.md) for ordering, heap limits, caches, bundle contracts, and topology changes.

## Writing tests

Test names describe observable behavior. Prefer pure decisions and narrow external boundaries. Cover invalid input, boundaries, ordering, recovery, permissions, transactions, interoperability, and forbidden transitions, not shallow existence.

See [Test authoring](test-authoring.md) for frontend, Rust, SQLite, security, UI, and coverage guidance.
